c yThere are many editions of the encyclopaedia and the number of mentions of subject terms in the book vary considerably over time. 
The use of ThemeRivers helps us to identify trends in encyclopaedia data across editions. Using time as a dimension and changes in width to represent changes in the intensity of subject terms reduces the burden of comprehension on the viewer, simplifies the task of tracking individual topics, and shows changes in topics in a more tangible way.
In the Encyclopaedia, economics trends change mainly because of historical events that occur and thus indirectly have an impact, such as wars, cultures, etc. 
We use a line graph to show the economic changes and to explain the reasons for the changes to the audience. This is done mainly through references to passages in encyclopaedic books that mark the existence of historical events and can specifically help the audience to improve their understanding of economic change.
The overall design style is based on the background of the encyclopaedia (it is the oldest surviving English language encyclopaedia in circulation), adding a sense of history and storytelling to give the user a more immersive and realistic feel as if they were reading an encyclopaedia.
