    "I can see which words have more mentions in Encyclopaedia Britannica, apart from some words that have no reference value, the main words are \"place\", \"water\", \"country \", \"king\", \"town\", \"city\", \"law \", \"man\", etc. I can realize from these words with a relatively high number of mentions that the people who edited this edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica mentioned a lot about history, cities, law, and famous people, which is the same purpose of the encyclopedia, which is to spread different types of knowledge to the readers. This data also helped me to grasp the main objects described in the seventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which could provide some ideas for the direction of subsequent research, and it also provided some ideas for understanding the dominant culture of the world at the time. It was in the context of the society of the time that the editors edited this edition of the encyclopaedia, and it will be very different from the previous editions of the encyclopaedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of references to different subjects also varies, as can be seen in the fact that 'law', 'history', 'art', and 'science' all fall into a relatively different category. This may indicate which topics are more important, and there are also some links between different topics, such as the relationship between law and history. References to the history of a region must also refer to the history of that region, as law is essential as a bridge to the construction of human culture.\n"

In the non-standard statistics, assuming that all genders are covered, it can be seen that the number of men is much higher than the number of women. This may be due to the fact that male greats are the main subjects of the editor's study (kings, dukes, male writers, etc.), while women are less frequently represented. It may be that there is not a great deal of documented data on women and there is not a great deal of material on the subject. It may be that women did not play a large role in the development of society.\n",
