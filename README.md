Our project is an interactive projection installation of Encyclopaedia Britannica. Since we got datasets from the National Library of Scotland, and found that it has 8 editions of 195 volumes, which is difficult for people to find information they need. For the sake of enhancing the Encyclopaedia Britannicaâ€™s readability, interactivity and enjoyment, we try to find specific relationships in it and use creative methods to immerse audiences in reading.

The encyclopedia text data analysis is in **`./G14_Encyclopedia_data visualization`** (including the pre-preparation description of the function library to be installed)
All the original data are in `./Encyclopedia Britannica V1-V8`
The realization process of "Touching the Encyclopaedia" interactive device is in `/Interactive Board` and visualization library `/Dynamic effect_AE`
